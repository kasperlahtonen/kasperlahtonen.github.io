                <strong>AI and it’s effect on our work and to your costs</strong> <div class="chapter-break"></div>

                We want to give you three tangible examples of how AI has changed how we do our work.
                We had to do a python implementation of multiple complicated functions from a research paper.
                In the past this would’ve been at least a three day task, but with modern tools we managed
                to get it done in three hours. This is one of many, and no, it is not an exaggeration.
                There are the larger clear gains like the previous examples, but then there are the almost
                invisible advantages that cut our work significantly over the day when combined together. 
                Most of my coding consists of me pressing tab and the IDE finishing the line of code for me. 
                I mean, I know how to do this, I was unfortunately one of the last generations who learned to 
                code without the help of AI, but now that these tools are here, we might as well use them. 
                Unless of course you are one of those people who abstain from warm showers because you didn’t warm 
                the water yourself, didn’t think so. Luddites never win in the end. 
                You can also learn new things so fast. Take it from yours truly, who built this very website from 
                scratch in few days without any previous experience in HTML or CSS.

                <div class="chapter-break"></div>

                <strong>What we can do for you</strong> <div class="chapter-break"></div>

                You can get a good idea of our strengths from the projects section, but our real core strength is being
                able to do wide variety of things. If there is one good thing about studying mathematics 
                (trust us, there aren’t many), it’s that you realise you can learn difficult stuff super fast. 
                Now, that doesn’t mean we are going to accept every single project under the sun, no. 
                It wouldn’t serve anyone if we promised something we can’t deliver. We are trying to build lasting 
                solutions and long term relationships, that is not possible by doing sloppy work. We work widely, 
                but never without quality. 
                Our value proposition is not that we are just mindless coders who do as we are told. This does not mean 
                that we don’t deliver what is asked, we do if the goals and methods are clearly defined, but when they are 
                not—which often is the case—we are excellent in finding the the best approach to any particular problem 
                and then implementing the solution to it.
                
                <div class="chapter-break"></div>

                <strong>So what next (Call to action)</strong> <div class="chapter-break"></div>

                If you’re this far it means that you’re probably somewhat interested, or at least intrigued. 
                Maybe you a have a vague idea of what we could do for you, or perhaps a burning desire to automate 
                the war zone that is your inbox in the morning (that, too, can be done). But where do you even start, 
                aren’t these outsourcing projects gruesome and famously difficult to arrange? No, not with us. 
                Let’s just go grab a simple lunch and see what we can do. Oftentimes we’ve agreed on proof of concepts 
                or MVPs over the first one or two meetings and from there off we go. And hey, worst case, you’ll just 
                end up having a free lunch with the least autistic mathematician from our team (that’s a fuckin 
                deal if I’ve ever seen one) Or we can just do Zoom or some shit… boring.
